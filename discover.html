				<h2>"I was pleasantly surprised to find that Extraordinary Attorney Woo effectively captures the many challenges of adjusting to adulthood as an autistic person who just wants to fit in. I could really connect with this sense of isolation depicted on screen. It was emotional to see a show articulate the social aspects of disability so well."</h2>

				<p>"Extraordinary Attorney Woo" is an award-winning Korean Drama that aired in 2022 and can be watched on Netflix. This popular drama follows Woo Young Woo who is an autistic and gifted lawyer. Over the course of the 16-episode drama, she faces discrimination and prejudices at work from her neurotypical peers, has difficulty socializing, and overcomes personal adversities. The show also has themes of friendship (between Woo Young Woo and Dong Geu Rami) and romance (between Woo Young Woo and Lee Jun Ho). It's overall a feel-good show that explores some more sensitive and avoided topics, such as autism, ableism, and bullying.</p>
				<p>While not perfect, "Extraordinary Attorney Woo" had overall positive public reception. Especially because autism is not as widely spoken about or recognized in South Korea, this production was an important step forward in autistic representation in popular culture. Many people also thought this representation was an "honest portrayal of autism."</p>
				<p>However, some people wished that Woo didn't have so many "gifted" characteristics. Being seen as a "genius" is a common attribute people associate with autistic people, even though being an autistic savant is very rare. Others also may have felt uncomfortable that the actress for Woo Young Woo -- Park Eun Bin -- is neurotypical.</p>
				<p>But overall, I think "Extraordinary Attorney Woo" offers a great platform to continue integrating more points of views and representations in successful popular/mainstream culture and entertainment.</p>
